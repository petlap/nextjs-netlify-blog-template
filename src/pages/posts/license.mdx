It’s undeniable that a large percentage of IT professionals view their services as a mix of cloud approaches, some of which run independently from one another –based in a public cloud or on premises.

Nonetheless, when discussing a utopic way of monitoring IT activities, our minds jump to a hybrid cloud computing deployment, with workloads operating in an integrated and seamless manner across both public and private clouds.

Nowadays, the application of workloads across different platforms and clouds is still regarded with its own set of problems. Despite the apparent hype surround cloud storage and its capabilities and limitations, as there are certain hurdles we can’t deny –particularly when talking about commercial use. Among the most common we have data latency, access speed, security, data portability, compliance, all everyday occurrences for businesses still operating under the model of collocating the workload on a single cloud. Because of this, it can be increasingly difficult to provide efficient and highly responsive services –particularly when an organization maintains full control over the private but not over the public cloud.

By contrast, an actual hybrid cloud computing deployment is dependent on management, support, adequate connectivity and the open-mindedness of how emerging technologies (i.e., microservices) can influence profits.

## Hybrid cloud management

When discussing [hybrid cloud management](http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/answer/How-do-hybrid-cloud-architecture-types-differ), we are referring to services which are capable of controlling and monitoring workloads and their progress regardless of where they are stored. The primary capabilities which need to apply to this service include workload provisioning (i.e., through the use of containers like Docker or LXD) and the identification of the root problems and solutions.

Moreover, we can’t forget about the importance of lifecycle management, not limited to the ability to close these services down or to recover licenses and resources that you require.

## Hybrid cloud connectivity

Possibly one of the first steps in starting a hybrid computing deployment is ensuring connectivity –looking for public cloud providers capable of supporting high-performance interconnectivity. Some examples of these types of services include Amazon Web Services Direct Connect, Google Cloud Interconnect, or even Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute.

The three can all provide this functionality, but they do not connect directly into private data centers. Instead, the servers terminate at defined points of presence (POPs), from where businesses must then rely on WAN connections or leased lines in order to facilitate a connection to their private facility. This can be done using Multiprotocol Label Switching links or even virtual LANs –ensuring high performance and availability.

It’s essential to note that while some service providers do offer POPs, it’s not that common. Other colocations supply a mix of private and public connectivity from cloud providers, or they can even provide consumers access to services from public cloud providers hosted within their privately-owned facilities (i.e., in-facility connections).

## Hybrid cloud and the importance of microservices

Innovation is often the key to success. If you want your business to differ from other services available nowadays, you have to continually seek advanced functionality –i.e., the ability to use microservices and negotiate technical contracts like a pro.

So far, we have yet to see the full potential of microservices, and there are very few standards to help drive this approach further. Nonetheless, for a hybrid cloud computing deployment to meet its dormant powers, the potential for one service has to be one where pairing dominates.

The reality is that at the present moment, the vast number of microservices is hard-coded. To put things into perspective, service X responds to service Y, and the interactions between the two are coded and meant to correspond. However, in the future we can expect that service X will be able to request and use any responding service, not merely Y –regardless if the data is stored in a public or private cloud.

## Conclusion

To sum up, to dispel the problems faced by cloud computing, storage suppliers came up with an innovative solution: hybrid cloud storage. By using this service, your data can either reside on-site or in a private or public cloud –depending on regulatory compliance rules, the involved economics, performance needs, and other security issues.

Nowadays hybrid cloud computing is most commonly used for archiving and off-site backup, mainly since it’s a relatively budget-friendly way to protect yourself from site failures. The best part? Well, hybrid cloud computing is also less prone to bandwidth limitations and latency.
